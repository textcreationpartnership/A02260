            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ove among the Ancients was pourtrayed and ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by, and under the image of a woman cloathed in a greene gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having written in her forehead, <hi>Procul &amp; Propè,</hi> afarre off, and neere at hand; in her breaſt, <hi>Mors &amp; vita,</hi> life and death; in the hemme of her garment, <hi>Hyems &amp; aeſtas,</hi> winter and ſummer; in her ſide, <hi>Vulnus apertum,</hi> an open wound, thorough which her heart within might be ſeen. My love to you (farre from me be all baſe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ſelfe-commendation) hath beene very fervent, <hi>like the love of women;</hi> greene, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver withering, alwayes freſh and flouriſhing; not only while I was preſent with you, but ſince
<pb facs="tcp:3605:3"/> I have been abſent from you, the ſenſe at leaſt of my love hath beene more abundant towards you: ſuch hath been my love to you, that <hi>you were in my heart to live and to dye with you:</hi> I could willingly in winter and in ſummer, in all changes, have continued your ſervant, <hi>as Jacob ſerved Labans flock in the heat and in the cold:</hi> My heart is open to you, as a Bridegroomes heart and houſe is open to receive the Bride; and had your former beene like the laſt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations of your love towards me, I am aſſured all the proffers and perſwaſions of the world, ſhould never have drawne me from you. Great is the power and ſtrength of affection, with which faithfull Miniſters love the Lords people: as grace is more powerfull then nature, ſo is their love ſtronger then the love of nature: <hi>Non mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus vos diligo</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ambroſe) quos genui ex Evangelio, quàm ſi ſuſcepiſſem conjugio; gratia quippe vehementior eſt ad diligendum quàm na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi> I love you no leſſe whom I have begotten by the Goſpel, then if I had begotten you in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall conjunction; becauſe grace hath more energy and vehemency in the way and worke of love, then nature. And in my unfained love, and as a pledge and teſtimony of my never-dying love, I have ſent you theſe papers, part of which is the laſt Legacy I had to beſtow upon you at the time of my departure from you: It is very uſefull for all Chriſtians to renew the memory of the paſt labours of Gods meſſengers.</p>
            <p>Every good child deſires a copy of his Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:3605:3"/> will, to ſee his Fathers love, to know his Fathers gift, to remember and obſerve his Fathers charge and counſell: Children within ſome few dayes after their Fathers death expect the receipt of their parents Legacie and bequeath; and loving children are ever very glad to accept, and very carefull to keep their parents laſt gift, though of ſlender worth: the laſt words of Gods Miniſters, our ſpirituall parents, doe commonly (like the words of dying men) take the deepeſt impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their hearers. True Chriſtians thinke often, and put great price upon the laſt labours of Gods Miniſters: I therefore here preſent unto you that which I publiſhed as my laſt miniſteriall Will and Teſtament among you, with ſome part of my poore labours ſince beſtowed on others, deſiring you, like loving children, to accept it; like provident and carefull children, to make the humble, true, and beſt uſe of it: A ſmall gift well uſed, proves many times an inſtrument of great inrichment.</p>
            <p>Though I ceaſe to be your Miniſter, and am now no more your Inſtructer, yet I cannot ceaſe to bee your true, though weake and unworthy, perhaps deſpiſed, friend: and <hi>as ointment and perfume</hi> (according to <hi>Solomon) rejoice the heart,</hi> ſo would I gladly by hearty counſell, diſtill on you the drops of ſome friendly, ſome Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and ſpirituall ſweetneſſe, to the rejoicing and revivement of your ſoules: and <hi>as iron ſharpens iron,</hi> ſo am I willing by ſome words of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, exhortation, and excitation, to ſhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:3605:4"/> and quicken your affections.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore as a conſtant lover of your ſoules, and a carefull remembrancer of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, intreat and perſwade you all, 1. To grow in the ſight and ſenſe of your ſinne: Beware of hardneſſe, keepe your hearts ſoft and contrite, nouriſh and maintaine all tenderneſſe in your conſciences: ſenſe of miſery ſweetens mercy; the feeling of ſin breeds both the loathing and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ſinne; mans ſight of his owne vileneſſe, makes Chriſt very precious, and breeds a low o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all worldly excellencies. The Hart fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within him the operation of the ſerpents poyſon, goes from the thornes and thickets and paſſeth over the greene and pleaſant paſtures, deſires nothing but the fountaine: ſenſe of the venome of ſinne and uncleanneſſe, makes man go from the thornes and thickets of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares and riches, and paſſe from the greene medowes of carnall pleaſures, the ſoule being reſtleſſe untill it comes to Chriſt Jeſus the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all ſpirituall refreſhments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, take heed, deceive not your ſelves with ſhewes and ſhadowes in ſtead of ſubſtance, with a forme in ſtead of the power of godlineſſe: As the Poets fable it of <hi>Ixion</hi> imbracing a cloud in ſtead of <hi>Juno;</hi> or as mothers in haſte ſomtimes catch at the ſwadling clothes, and leave the child behind them. It is very dangerous to ſtay and applaud our ſelves in the ceremony of Religion and godlineſs, not taking with us the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> as ſometimes <hi>Mary and Joſeph went on with
<pb facs="tcp:3605:4"/> the multitude for company, and left Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them:</hi> all religious obſervations prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall, frivolous and fruitleſſe, if in them we ſee not, taſte not, receive not, enjoy not Chriſt: religious exerciſes are loſt labours to the ſoule that gaines not the Lord Jeſus.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be truely meeke and humble, bee emptied of all opinion of your owne worth and wiſedome; this will make you wiſe unto ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He that is in the low pits and caves of the earth ſees the ſtarres in the firmament, when they who are on the tops of the mountaines diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them not. Hee that is moſt humble ſees moſt of heaven: <hi>Bona eſt via humilitatis</hi> (ſaith <hi>Bernard) quâ veritas inquiritur, charitas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur, &amp; generationes ſapientiae percipiuntur.</hi> Good (ſaith he) is the way of humility, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by truth is ſearched out, charity is obtained, and the generations of wiſdome are perceived. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility exalteth; he that is moſt humble, is, and ſhalbe moſt honourable. <hi>Moſes</hi> was the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt man on earth, and God made him the moſt honourable, calling him up unto himſelfe in the mount, and making him the Leader of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Gedeon</hi> was very little in his own eyes, <hi>the leaſt of his fathers houſe</hi> in his owne apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and God marvellouſly exalted him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the deliverer of Iſrael. As mans pride is attended with infamy, ſo is mans meekneſſe waited on with glory. <hi>Vis magnus eſſe? incipe ab imo:</hi> Wilt thou be great? begin from below, ſaith the Father. As the roots of the tree deſcend,
<pb facs="tcp:3605:5"/> ſo the branches aſcend: this makes the ſoule ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of grace, as the low grounds of water, and the broken earth of ſeed. God gives grace to the humble, as men poure liquor into an empty veſſell. The Altar under the Law was hollow, to receive the fire, the wood, and the ſacrifice: the heart of man under the Goſpel muſt be humble, empty of all ſpirituall pride and ſelfe-conceit, to receive the fire of the ſpirit, and Jeſus Chriſt, who offered himſelfe a ſacrifice for our ſinnes: this keeps the ſoule free from many darts of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans caſting, and ſnares of his ſpreading, as the low ſhrubs are free from many violent guſts and blaſts of wind, which ſhake and rent the taller trees. I have read of one, that ſeeing in a viſion many ſnares of the devill ſpread upon earth, he ſate downe and mourned, and ſaid within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, <hi>Quis pertranſiet iſta?</hi> Who ſhall paſſe through theſe? whereunto he heard a voice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering, <hi>Humilitas pertranſiet,</hi> Humility ſhall paſſe through them. The Divell hath leaſt power to faſten a temptation on him that is moſt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: hee that hath a gracious meaſure of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is neither affected with Satans proffers, nor terrified with his threatnings: This makes man peaceable in converſing with his brethren, fruitfull in well-doing, cheerfull in ſuffering, comfortable in every condition, conſtant in holy walking; this makes a man precious in the eyes of God, as a humble ſervant in the eyes of his Maſter. <hi>Qui parvus eſt in reputatione propriâ, magnus eſt in reputatione divinâ,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gregory:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3605:5"/> He that is little in his owne account, is great in Gods eſteeme. This makes the way and worke of man acceptable unto God, and alſo ſweetens and encreaſeth mans communion with God. If ever therefore you entend to enjoy Gods glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bleſſed preſence, labour for this humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and meekneſſe.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Bee ſervent and unfained in your love to God, his truth, and his children: this will make your language very gracious. <hi>Amantium mos eſt,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Chryſoſtome) ut amorem ſuum ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio tegere nequeunt:</hi> Lovers know not how to keepe ſilence; lovers of God are very full of gracious expreſſions: this will make you liberal, you ſhall give your ſelves to God and the ſervice of his Saints, as the men of Macedonia did: this will make you patient in ſuffering, as <hi>Jacob</hi> in his ſervice for <hi>Rachel:</hi> this will make you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the houſe of God with all alacrity, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, and diligence, as children their fathers houſe and table: this will make you joyfull in hearing the word of God, as the Bride in hearing the voice of the Bridegroome: this will make you carefull, free and full in the obſervation of Gods ſtatutes, as loving children in the obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their fathers precepts: this will make you diligent and rich in all good workes; the more man loves God, the more he ſtrives in all well-doing to glorifie God. Love, like fire, is not idle, but operative: <hi>Amor Dei</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory) nunquam otioſus eſt; operatur enim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna ſi eſt; ſi verò operari renuit, amor non eſt:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3605:6"/> The love of God (ſaith he) is never idle; for if it is, it worketh great things; but if it refuſe to work, it is not love. Love makes the yoke of God eaſie, and his worke delightfull; it is only want of love that makes the commandement a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: <hi>Tantò magis delectat opus bonum, quantò magis diligitur Deus ſummum &amp; incommutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le bonum,</hi> ſaith <hi>Auguſtine:</hi> A good work ſo much the more delighteth, by how much the more God the chiefeſt and unchangable good is loved.</p>
            <p>Love among ſome of the Ancients was reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to, and repreſented by the Sun: the Sunne inlightens the world; the more love the more light. Knowledge and love, like the water and the ice, beget each other; man loves God by knowing, and knows God by loving. God dwels in love, and where God is there is light: that mans light is darkneſſe which is not attended with the love of God and his teſtimonies: the Sunne makes the earth fertile; he that loves God cannot be barren, his love makes him fruitfull in all well-doing: the Sunne is ſwift and conſtant in his motion; love makes man cheerfull, ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and unwearied in running the race which God hath ſet before him: the Sunne is impaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, love is patient and invincible, it endureth all things; <hi>no floods can drown it, no waters can quench it.</hi> Want of love and affection is the maine cauſe of mans apoſtacy and back-ſliding: the Sunne caſteth his beames upward and downward, to the Eaſt and to the Weſt, to the North and to the South; Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:3605:6"/> love cauſeth its beames to aſcend to God above, and to deſcend to man beneath; to our friends on the right hand, to our enemies on the left hand; to them that are in the ſtate or grace before us, to them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t are in the ſtate of corruption behind us: love which is not in this ſenſe univerſall, is corrupt and carnall. The Sun beginning to aſcend in his circle, never goes back u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>till he comes to the higheſt degree thereof: true love abhorres apoſtacy, aſcends to more perfection, and ceaſeth not untill, like <hi>Eliahs fiery chariot,</hi> it hath car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the ſoule to heaven: If ever you meane to ſee and enjoy the God of love, labour for this love.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Be very ſerious, ſtudious, circumſpect, and carefull in all your walkings; ponder the path of your feet, like carefull travellers; conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weigh all your doings, let all your waies of the heart within, and worke without, be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered aright, according the rule of Gods word; every motion of the ſoule is a ſtep to life or a ſtep to death; a ſtep towards heaven or toward hell: Mans labour and ſervice is temporall, his wages and recompence eternall; therfore as <hi>Zeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> that famous Lymner, being demanded why he was ſo exact and ſerious, ſo long, ſo careful and curious in his workmanſhip, anſwered, <hi>Diu pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, quia aeternitati pingo;</hi> I am long in painting, becauſe I paint unto eternity. We all paint un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to eternity; every one of our actions tends to an eternity of joyes or ſorrowes; all our temporall actions are as ſeeds of eternity ſowne by us: a
<pb facs="tcp:3605:7"/> temporall ſeed an eternall harveſt: we ſpeak, we heare, we write, we read, we pray, we ſing, we conferre, we worke, we thinke unto eternity: how exact and ſerious ſhould we be in our ſhort walking, the end whereof is eternall! <hi>Vigilanti curâ</hi> (ſaith <hi>Gregory) per cuncta opera intentio nobis penſanda eſt, ut nihil temporale in his quae agit appetat, ſed totam ſe in ſoliditate aeternita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis figat:</hi> The intention is thorough all our works to bee weighed with vigilant care, that in the things which it doth, it may deſire nothing tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, but wholly faſten it ſelfe on that which is eternall: hee that walkes not circumſpectly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prives himſelfe of an eternity of felicity, and caſts himſelfe into an eternity of miſery: better live ſtrictly for a time, then live miſerably for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; nay, bee aſſured that even for the preſent, there is more comfort in one dayes ſtrict walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with God, then in a thouſand dayes looſe converſing with men. Did men know the peace, joy, ſweetneſſe, boldneſſe, honour and triumph of holy walking, they would inſtantly and for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver abandon all diſſolute living: heaven is the paradice of all joyes; he that in his holy walking commeth neareſt unto heaven, is doubtleſſe of all men the moſt joyfull. O ſay not then, as a man of noble blood and acute wit, but profane life, ſometime did, when being demanded what he thought of the auſtere life of the godly, and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centious life of the wicked, anſwered, <hi>Cum iſtis mallem vivere, cum illis mori mallem;</hi> I had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther live with the latter, I had rather dye with
<pb facs="tcp:3605:7"/> the former. But as you deſire to dye the death of the righteous, ſo bee very ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous and ſtudious, very vigilant and indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious to live the life of the righteous: Never promiſe your ſelves a bleſſed death without a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life.</p>
            <p>Laſtly, Be ſtedfaſt in adhering to the truth: be not like children carried to and fro with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vaine perſwaſion; nor like ſhips without an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, toſſed up and downe with the winde of every empty doctrine: But be conſtant in follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth, as the Wiſemen did the ſtarre, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>till you come home to Chriſt; and as the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did the fiery pillar, untill you come to the heavenly Canaan. <hi>Buy the truth</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon) and ſell it not;</hi> you can never over-buy it what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever you give for it; you can never ſufficiently ſell it, if you have all the world in exchange for it. It is ſaid of <hi>Caeſar, Major fuit cura Caeſari libellorum quàm purpurae;</hi> He had greater care of his books then of his royall robes: for ſwim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming through the waters to eſcape his enemies, he carried his books in his hand above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, but loſt his robe. What are <hi>Caeſars</hi> bookes to Gods booke, and his learning to Gods truth, more then a glow-worme to the ſunne? Bee you therefore more carefull of the Goſpel then of any earthly poſſeſſion: though you bee driven into the deepe waters of affliction, and there loſe all your worldly fulneſſe, yet hold faſt the Goſpel of Chriſt Jeſus: you ſhall finde infinitely more worth and comfort
<pb facs="tcp:3605:8"/> in the Goſpel, then in all the treaſure of the world.</p>
            <p>It is reported of <hi>Alexander</hi> the Great, that hee had alwayes <hi>Homers</hi> Iliads under his pillow, and preferred them above <hi>Dari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> his moſt precious and coſtly cheſt: what are <hi>Homers</hi> Iliads to Chriſts Goſpel? or <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> cheſt to the invaluable treaſure which is in Chriſt? Have therefore the booke of God ever with you, when you lye downe, when you riſe up, when you walke abroad; have it in your underſtandings, to know it; in your imaginations, to thinke and meditate upon it; in your memories, to remember it; in your hearts, to love it, to rejoice and delight your ſelves in it; to ſolace, refreſh, and comfort your ſoules with it; in your tongues, to ſpeake of it, to edifie and ſtrengthen one another by it; give it preheminence above the chiefeſt wordly ſubſtance. The loſſe of all cannot make man miſerable, as long as hee ſincerely and fully adheres unto, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyes the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>Make this therefore your conſtant and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall light, to guide you; your heavenly Manna, to feed you; your celeſtiall treaſure, to enrich you; your ſpirituall well-ſpring, to refreſh and fill you; your firme and ſure an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, to ſuſtaine and ſtay you; your holy and gracious Schoole, to edifie you in the knowledge, faith, and love of Chrſt; to raviſh your ſoules with the apprehenſion of

Whatſoever fulneſſe or perfection can bee mentioned, deſired, imagined, it is to bee found in him. It is abſurd to runne to a rotten Ciſterne for

                        <hi>love darkneſſe rather then light, becauſe their deeds are evill. Hee that doth evill hateth the light, neither commeth hee to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. Iob</hi> ſaith of Theeves,<note n="g" place="margin">Iob 24.17.</note> 
                        <hi>The morning is to them as the ſhadow of death: if one know them, they are in the terrours of the ſhadow of death.</hi> To men that rob God by their impieties, the morning, the truth which ſhineth forth like the<note n="h" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.19.</note> 
                        <hi>Morning ſtarre,</hi> is as the ſhadow of death; if one know them, if the Miniſter detect and lay open their ſinne, their profane and evill eſtate, it is a great terrour to them, it troubles them, as the ſtar did<note n="i" place="margin">Mat. 2.2.</note> 
                        <hi>Herod &amp; the men of Ieruſalem.</hi> Man can never take pleaſure in that ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of light which ſhineth from Chriſt Jeſus, untill hee hath emptied himſelfe of <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the fulneſſe of his corruptions. Secondly, from the want of love to the truth: The woman that wants love to her husband, readily proſtitutes her ſelfe to ſtrangers: The ſoule that loves not Chriſt and his truth, doth eaſily open it ſelfe to corrupt and deceitfull doctrines; becauſe they<note n="k" place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.9, 10.</note> 
                        <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the love of the truth that they might bee ſaved; for this cauſe,</hi> ſaith the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle,

                        <hi>God ſhall ſend them ſtrong deluſions, that they ſhould beleeve a lye.</hi> Corrupt and carnall doctrine is very welcome where the love of the truth is wanting: hee that receives not the truth into his affection, as well as into his judgement, will ſoone bee drawne from it. Under the Law it was uſuall for a man that married a<note n="l" place="margin">Deut. 24.1.</note> woman, if hee loved her not, to give her a bill of divorcement, and ſend her out of his houſe: It is common with men under the Goſpel, who, in regard of externall cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant and profeſſion, are married to the truth; yet afterwards, through the want of love, they give the truth a bill of divorce, and become ſtrangers to it. It is love to the truth that cauſeth man to continue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant with it.<note n="m" place="margin">Cant. 8.6, 7.</note> 
                        <hi>Love it and you ſhall never depart from it.</hi> Thirdly, from a deſire of novelty: Men naturally deſire new things; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> as they deſire new faſhions of apparrell for their bodies, ſo new doctrines for their ſoules. The eye is little affected with the Sun, becauſe it ſhineth every day; it much admires a blazing ſtar, becauſe but ſeldome ſeene. Things of greateſt worth, becauſe common, are little eſteemed; vaine and empty things, becauſe new, are much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded.

No man ſo deſires change of new and ſtrange doctrines, as he that meanes not to change his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation: were the hearts of men truly chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, the true and common doctrine of Chriſt would bee very pleaſant, the ſoule <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> would never grow weary of it. Fourthly, from their eſtrangement from Chriſt, they diſcerne not Chriſts beauties, they taſte not Chriſts ſweetneſſe, they feele not Chriſts goodneſſe: there is no ſutableneſſe

Such is the obſtinacie and hardneſſe of their hearts, that the hammer of the Word without the almighty hand of God, can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver breake nor bruiſe them. Such is the diſtance and difference between God and the ſoules of men, that were not Chriſt a perſon of infinite worth, hee could never make any ſatisfaction, never work a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation.

                     <p>Fourthly, ſuch are the afflictions of Chriſts members, Satan doth ſo beſiege &amp; aſſault them, as ſometimes the <hi>Amoritiſh</hi> Princes did the<note n="p" place="margin">Ioſ. 10.6</note>

                     <p>Fifthly, ſuch is the perfection that God requires in his people, that, were not the fulneſſe of the God-head in Chriſt, hee could not <hi>cloath</hi> them with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; hee could not <hi>purge</hi> out their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, as <hi>Iordan</hi> purged <hi>Naaman;</hi> hee

Peace, in regard of the Subject where it reſideth,<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 5.3. Rom. 14.17.

Wee have the beſt ſeed to ſow, the richeſt voyage to make, the chiefeſt merchandiſe to buy, and yet wee regard not our day, eſteeme not the time of our viſitation, entertaine not the proffer which God of his free and abundant mercie doth make. O beloved, conſider,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, how juſt it will bee with God not to heare us in our miſery, if wee refuſe to heare him inviting us in the multitude of
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:3605:139"/> his mercie: ſhall the maſter heare the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant requeſting, if the ſervant regard not the maſter requiring?

                     <hi>Thou my ſonne Solomon, know thou the God of thy father, and ſerve him, with a perfect heart, and with a willing minde: for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: If thou ſeeke him, hee will bee found of thee, but if thou forſake him hee will caſt thee off for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, doth not our refuſall of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie when it is offered, cut off all hope of mercie for hereafter? Doth not the reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of a proffered pardon turn the Kings favour into anger againſt the malefactor?

                  <p>Thirdly, will not our continuance in

Where trees have growne long, and the roots are deepe, the earth is very much rent and torne before the tree is plucked up. Doth not the traveller who hath walked long and farre out of his way, goe backe with much ſorrow, ſadneſs, and griefe of heart?</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, will God be well pleaſed that we ſhall ſpend all the flower and ſtrength of our time in Satans ſervice, and when wee are old, and can ſerve ſin no longer, come crowd and thruſt our ſelves into his ſervice?</p>

                  <p>Secondly, by way of commemoration, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> I may tell you, Firſt, how hee profeſſed <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> much ſorrow for his ſinnes: Mans ſin doth ever prove mans ſorrow; it is the ſhame of man to commit ſin, it is the honour of man to confeſſe and forſake his ſin; though ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row conſtrained and carnall be alwaies un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptable, yet true and godly ſorrow is ever availeable to ſalvation: <hi>He that ſowes in tears ſhall reap in joy, Pſa.</hi> 126.5.</p>

                  <p>Thirdly, he ſpake of a great change which <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> God of late had wrought in him: Hee that is not changed by the gracious hand of God in this life, is never received by the merciful hand of God in the next life: the procraſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

                  <p>Fourthly, the rehearſal of Gods mercies, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/>
                     <pb n="286" facs="tcp:3605:157"/> upon condition of true repentance, ſeemed much to affect him.

                  <p>Three things there are very memorable, touching Gods goodneſſe in this place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards mee, which I cannot paſſe in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>

Bleſſe, Lord, his ſubſtance, furniſh and fill him with all inward and outward endowments, and proſper all his godly labours.</p>
                  <p>Let this people, Lord, as thy beloved, dwell in ſafety by thee, and cover them under the wings of thy protection all the day long, and for ever dwell, O Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween their ſhoulders; ſtabliſh &amp; ſettle with them thine ordinance, make this place thy habitation, and thy reſt for ever.</p>

                  <p>The Lord make your glory like <hi>the Firſtling of a Bullocke,</hi> for your joy and gladneſſe, for your excellencie and amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſſe in the eyes of all beholders, and for your growth in all ſpirituall gifts and graces; and <hi>your hornes like the hornes of an Unicorne,</hi> for your ſtrength and prevailing over all oppoſing powers.</p>
                  <p>The Lord make you to rejoyce <hi>in your going out, and in your tents: The Lord bring you to his holy mountaine, and make you there to offer the ſacrifice of righteouſneſſe.</hi> The Lord enlarge you in diſſolving all your ſinnes, in deſpelling all your ſorrowes, in removing all your troubles, in filling you with all temporall and heavenly fulneſſe; and make you like <hi>a Lyon</hi> for your victory over all your adverſaries for your vigilancy and watchfulneſſe, and for your reſolution and courage in all godly undertakings.</p>
                  <pb n="53" facs="tcp:3605:198"/>
                  <p>The Lord ſatisfie you with his favour, the Lord fill you with his bleſſing, and make you acceptable in his eyes, and in the eyes of your brethren.</p>
                  <p>And let me charge you now, Brethren, before my miniſteriall breath expire, as <hi>David,</hi> a little before his death, charged his ſonne <hi>Solomon,</hi>

                     <hi>And you, my brethren, know yee the God of your fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for the Lord ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts: If you ſeeke him, hee will be found of you, but if you forſake him, hee will caſt you off for ever.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let me now before I leave you, and in the concluſion of my Miniſterie, pray for you, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> did for the people in the concluſion of his Epiſtle,<note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 5.10.</note>
