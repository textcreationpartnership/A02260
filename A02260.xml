            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">L</seg>Ove among the Ancients was pourtrayed and ≈øha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowed out by, and under the image of a woman cloathed in a greene gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, having written in her forehead, <hi>Procul &amp; Prop√®,</hi> afarre off, and neere at hand; in her brea≈øt, <hi>Mors &amp; vita,</hi> life and death; in the hemme of her garment, <hi>Hyems &amp; ae≈øtas,</hi> winter and ≈øummer; in her ≈øide, <hi>Vulnus apertum,</hi> an open wound, thorough which her heart within might be ≈øeen. My love to you (farre from me be all ba≈øe flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and ≈øelfe-commendation) hath beene very fervent, <hi>like the love of women;</hi> greene, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver withering, alwayes fre≈øh and flouri≈øhing; not only while I was pre≈øent with you, but ≈øince
<pb facs="tcp:3605:3"/> I have been ab≈øent from you, the ≈øen≈øe at lea≈øt of my love hath beene more abundant towards you: ≈øuch hath been my love to you, that <hi>you were in my heart to live and to dye with you:</hi> I could willingly in winter and in ≈øummer, in all changes, have continued your ≈øervant, <hi>as Jacob ≈øerved Labans flock in the heat and in the cold:</hi> My heart is open to you, as a Bridegroomes heart and hou≈øe is open to receive the Bride; and had your former beene like the la≈øt manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtations of your love towards me, I am a≈ø≈øured all the proffers and per≈øwa≈øions of the world, ≈øhould never have drawne me from you. Great is the power and ≈øtrength of affection, with which faithfull Mini≈øters love the Lords people: as grace is more powerfull then nature, ≈øo is their love ≈øtronger then the love of nature: <hi>Non mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus vos diligo</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Ambro≈øe) quos genui ex Evangelio, qu√†m ≈øi ≈øu≈øcepi≈ø≈øem conjugio; gratia quippe vehementior e≈øt ad diligendum qu√†m na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura.</hi> I love you no le≈ø≈øe whom I have begotten by the Go≈øpel, then if I had begotten you in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimoniall conjunction; becau≈øe grace hath more energy and vehemency in the way and worke of love, then nature. And in my unfained love, and as a pledge and te≈øtimony of my never-dying love, I have ≈øent you the≈øe papers, part of which is the la≈øt Legacy I had to be≈øtow upon you at the time of my departure from you: It is very u≈øefull for all Chri≈øtians to renew the memory of the pa≈øt labours of Gods me≈ø≈øengers.</p>
            <p>Every good child de≈øires a copy of his Fathers
<pb facs="tcp:3605:3"/> will, to ≈øee his Fathers love, to know his Fathers gift, to remember and ob≈øerve his Fathers charge and coun≈øell: Children within ≈øome few dayes after their Fathers death expect the receipt of their parents Legacie and bequeath; and loving children are ever very glad to accept, and very carefull to keep their parents la≈øt gift, though of ≈ølender worth: the la≈øt words of Gods Mini≈øters, our ≈øpirituall parents, doe commonly (like the words of dying men) take the deepe≈øt impre≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in their hearers. True Chri≈øtians thinke often, and put great price upon the la≈øt labours of Gods Mini≈øters: I therefore here pre≈øent unto you that which I publi≈øhed as my la≈øt mini≈øteriall Will and Te≈øtament among you, with ≈øome part of my poore labours ≈øince be≈øtowed on others, de≈øiring you, like loving children, to accept it; like provident and carefull children, to make the humble, true, and be≈øt u≈øe of it: A ≈ømall gift well u≈øed, proves many times an in≈øtrument of great inrichment.</p>
            <p>Though I cea≈øe to be your Mini≈øter, and am now no more your In≈øtructer, yet I cannot cea≈øe to bee your true, though weake and unworthy, perhaps de≈øpi≈øed, friend: and <hi>as ointment and perfume</hi> (according to <hi>Solomon) rejoice the heart,</hi> ≈øo would I gladly by hearty coun≈øell, di≈øtill on you the drops of ≈øome friendly, ≈øome Chri≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an and ≈øpirituall ≈øweetne≈ø≈øe, to the rejoicing and revivement of your ≈øoules: and <hi>as iron ≈øharpens iron,</hi> ≈øo am I willing by ≈øome words of admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, exhortation, and excitation, to ≈øhar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen
<pb facs="tcp:3605:4"/> and quicken your affections.</p>
            <p>Let me therefore as a con≈øtant lover of your ≈øoules, and a carefull remembrancer of your wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, intreat and per≈øwade you all, 1. To grow in the ≈øight and ≈øen≈øe of your ≈øinne: Beware of hardne≈ø≈øe, keepe your hearts ≈øoft and contrite, nouri≈øh and maintaine all tenderne≈ø≈øe in your con≈øciences: ≈øen≈øe of mi≈øery ≈øweetens mercy; the feeling of ≈øin breeds both the loathing and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of ≈øinne; mans ≈øight of his owne vilene≈ø≈øe, makes Chri≈øt very precious, and breeds a low o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of all worldly excellencies. The Hart fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within him the operation of the ≈øerpents poy≈øon, goes from the thornes and thickets and pa≈ø≈øeth over the greene and plea≈øant pa≈øtures, de≈øires nothing but the fountaine: ≈øen≈øe of the venome of ≈øinne and uncleanne≈ø≈øe, makes man go from the thornes and thickets of world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly cares and riches, and pa≈ø≈øe from the greene medowes of carnall plea≈øures, the ≈øoule being re≈øtle≈ø≈øe untill it comes to Chri≈øt Je≈øus the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of all ≈øpirituall refre≈øhments.</p>
            <p>Secondly, take heed, deceive not your ≈øelves with ≈øhewes and ≈øhadowes in ≈øtead of ≈øub≈øtance, with a forme in ≈øtead of the power of godline≈ø≈øe: As the Poets fable it of <hi>Ixion</hi> imbracing a cloud in ≈øtead of <hi>Juno;</hi> or as mothers in ha≈øte ≈øomtimes catch at the ≈øwadling clothes, and leave the child behind them. It is very dangerous to ≈øtay and applaud our ≈øelves in the ceremony of Religion and godline≈øs, not taking with us the <hi>Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øus,</hi> as ≈øometimes <hi>Mary and Jo≈øeph went on with
<pb facs="tcp:3605:4"/> the multitude for company, and left Chri≈øt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them:</hi> all religious ob≈øervations prove com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plementall, frivolous and fruitle≈ø≈øe, if in them we ≈øee not, ta≈øte not, receive not, enjoy not Chri≈øt: religious exerci≈øes are lo≈øt labours to the ≈øoule that gaines not the Lord Je≈øus.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Be truely meeke and humble, bee emptied of all opinion of your owne worth and wi≈øedome; this will make you wi≈øe unto ≈øalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: He that is in the low pits and caves of the earth ≈øees the ≈øtarres in the firmament, when they who are on the tops of the mountaines di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerne them not. Hee that is mo≈øt humble ≈øees mo≈øt of heaven: <hi>Bona e≈øt via humilitatis</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Bernard) qu√¢ veritas inquiritur, charitas ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiritur, &amp; generationes ≈øapientiae percipiuntur.</hi> Good (≈øaith he) is the way of humility, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by truth is ≈øearched out, charity is obtained, and the generations of wi≈ødome are perceived. Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility exalteth; he that is mo≈øt humble, is, and ≈øhalbe mo≈øt honourable. <hi>Mo≈øes</hi> was the meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt man on earth, and God made him the mo≈øt honourable, calling him up unto him≈øelfe in the mount, and making him the Leader of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. <hi>Gedeon</hi> was very little in his own eyes, <hi>the lea≈øt of his fathers hou≈øe</hi> in his owne apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, and God marvellou≈øly exalted him, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him the deliverer of I≈ørael. As mans pride is attended with infamy, ≈øo is mans meekne≈ø≈øe waited on with glory. <hi>Vis magnus e≈ø≈øe? incipe ab imo:</hi> Wilt thou be great? begin from below, ≈øaith the Father. As the roots of the tree de≈øcend,
<pb facs="tcp:3605:5"/> ≈øo the branches a≈øcend: this makes the ≈øoule ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of grace, as the low grounds of water, and the broken earth of ≈øeed. God gives grace to the humble, as men poure liquor into an empty ve≈ø≈øell. The Altar under the Law was hollow, to receive the fire, the wood, and the ≈øacrifice: the heart of man under the Go≈øpel mu≈øt be humble, empty of all ≈øpirituall pride and ≈øelfe-conceit, to receive the fire of the ≈øpirit, and Je≈øus Chri≈øt, who offered him≈øelfe a ≈øacrifice for our ≈øinnes: this keeps the ≈øoule free from many darts of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans ca≈øting, and ≈ønares of his ≈øpreading, as the low ≈øhrubs are free from many violent gu≈øts and bla≈øts of wind, which ≈øhake and rent the taller trees. I have read of one, that ≈øeeing in a vi≈øion many ≈ønares of the devill ≈øpread upon earth, he ≈øate downe and mourned, and ≈øaid within him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe, <hi>Quis pertran≈øiet i≈øta?</hi> Who ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe through the≈øe? whereunto he heard a voice an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwering, <hi>Humilitas pertran≈øiet,</hi> Humility ≈øhall pa≈ø≈øe through them. The Divell hath lea≈øt power to fa≈øten a temptation on him that is mo≈øt hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble: hee that hath a gracious mea≈øure of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈ø≈øe is neither affected with Satans proffers, nor terrified with his threatnings: This makes man peaceable in conver≈øing with his brethren, fruitfull in well-doing, cheerfull in ≈øuffering, comfortable in every condition, con≈øtant in holy walking; this makes a man precious in the eyes of God, as a humble ≈øervant in the eyes of his Ma≈øter. <hi>Qui parvus e≈øt in reputatione propri√¢, magnus e≈øt in reputatione divin√¢,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Gregory:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3605:5"/> He that is little in his owne account, is great in Gods e≈øteeme. This makes the way and worke of man acceptable unto God, and al≈øo ≈øweetens and encrea≈øeth mans communion with God.

            <p>Fourthly, Bee ≈øervent and unfained in your love to God, his truth, and his children: this will make your language very gracious. <hi>Amantium mos e≈øt,</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Chry≈øo≈øtome) ut amorem ≈øuum ≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentio tegere nequeunt:</hi> Lovers know not how to keepe ≈øilence; lovers of God are very full of gracious expre≈ø≈øions: this will make you liberal, you ≈øhall give your ≈øelves to God and the ≈øervice of his Saints, as the men of Macedonia did: this will make you patient in ≈øuffering, as <hi>Jacob</hi> in his ≈øervice for <hi>Rachel:</hi> this will make you fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent the hou≈øe of God with all alacrity, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency, and diligence, as children their fathers hou≈øe and table: this will make you joyfull in hearing the word of God, as the Bride in hearing the voice of the Bridegroome: this will make you carefull, free and full in the ob≈øervation of Gods ≈øtatutes, as loving children in the ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their fathers precepts: this will make you diligent and rich in all good workes; the more man loves God, the more he ≈øtrives in all well-doing to glorifie God. Love, like fire, is not idle, but operative: <hi>Amor Dei</hi> (≈øaith <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory) nunquam otio≈øus e≈øt; operatur enim ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gna ≈øi e≈øt; ≈øi ver√≤ operari renuit, amor non e≈øt:</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:3605:6"/> The love of God (≈øaith he) is never idle; for if it is, it worketh great things; but if it refu≈øe to work, it is not love. Love makes the yoke of God ea≈øie, and his worke delightfull; it is only want of love that makes the commandement a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den: <hi>Tant√≤ magis delectat opus bonum, quant√≤ magis diligitur Deus ≈øummum &amp; incommutabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le bonum,</hi> ≈øaith <hi>Augu≈øtine:</hi> A good work ≈øo much the more delighteth, by how much the more God the chiefe≈øt and unchangable good is loved.</p>
            <p>Love among ≈øome of the Ancients was re≈øem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to, and repre≈øented by the Sun: the Sunne inlightens the world; the more love the more light. Knowledge and love, like the water and the ice, beget each other; man loves God by knowing, and knows God by loving. God dwels in love, and where God is there is light: that mans light is darkne≈ø≈øe which is not attended with the love of God and his te≈øtimonies: the Sunne makes the earth fertile; he that loves God cannot be barren, his love makes him fruitfull in all well-doing: the Sunne is ≈øwift and con≈øtant in his motion; love makes man cheerfull, ≈øpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and unwearied in running the race which God hath ≈øet before him: the Sunne is impa≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, love is patient and invincible, it endureth all things; <hi>no floods can drown it, no waters can quench it.</hi> Want of love and affection is the maine cau≈øe of mans apo≈øtacy and back-≈øliding: the Sunne ca≈øteth his beames upward and downward, to the Ea≈øt and to the We≈øt, to the North and to the South; Chri≈øtian
<pb facs="tcp:3605:6"/> love cau≈øeth its beames to a≈øcend to God above, and to de≈øcend to man beneath; to our friends on the right hand, to our enemies on the left hand; to them that are in the ≈øtate or grace before us, to them th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fiftly, Be very ≈øerious, ≈øtudious, circum≈øpect, and carefull in all your walkings; ponder the path of your feet, like carefull travellers; con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and weigh all your doings, let all your waies of the heart within, and worke without, be or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered aright, according the rule of Gods word; every motion of the ≈øoule is a ≈øtep to life or a ≈øtep to death; a ≈øtep towards heaven or toward hell: Mans labour and ≈øervice is temporall, his wages and recompence eternall; therfore as <hi>Zeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xes</hi> that famous Lymner, being demanded why he was ≈øo exact and ≈øerious, ≈øo long, ≈øo careful and curious in his workman≈øhip, an≈øwered, <hi>Diu pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, quia aeternitati pingo;</hi> I am long in painting, becau≈øe I paint unto eternity.
